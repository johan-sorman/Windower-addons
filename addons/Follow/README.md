## Follow

**Date:** Feb 2024.

**Description:** A basic addon to start follow a player, for multiboxers for example. <br/>
It's not any difference to /follow but easier to handle or use with other addons like send.<br/>
<br>

## Commands ##
`//fo help`: Displays help message
<br>
`//fo follow <name>`: Starts follow the <name> player.
<br>
`//fo stop`: Stops following
<br>

## Known Issues ##
As regular /follow if your followed character blinks from equipment swapping the follow will fail and cause the followee character to autorun in that direction. Using addons that stops blinking fixes this, it's not a bug of the addon but the design of the function in the game.

## Settings ##

There is no settings.
