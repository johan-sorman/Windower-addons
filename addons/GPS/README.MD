### Purpose
To make navigating FFXI's zones a bit easier for new players, and save players
from alt-tabbing to various websites to see how zones connect.

### Commands
<sup>Load the addon:<br>
//lua l gps</sup>

<sup>*Get help and all available commands:*<br>
//gps help</sup>
<br><br>
<sup>*Find exits for current zone:*<br>
//gps zone</sup>
<br><br>
<sup>*Find exits for a specific zone (don't send with auto-translate format), with or without quotes ("):*<br>
//gps "zone name" </sup>

<sup>*Hide the window and display in chat*<br>
//gps hide<br></sup>
        
<sup>*Hide the chat output and display in window*<br>
//gps show</sup>
<br><br>
### Known Issues:
<sup>This addon currently cannot process auto-translated phrases or zone names.
<br>
A work around is to auto-translate the zone name in game and backspace a few characters and then retype them.
<br>
This removes the auto-translate but keeps the name of the zone.</sup>
