**Description:** Make changing to weapon sets easier, see below.
<br/>

#### Commands

`gs c toggle mainset set` <br> Equip your mainset (to kill the NM as fast as possible after proc)<br>
<br>
`gs c toggle redproc set` <br>Equip next weapon in list<br>
It goes in this order: `{'Main', 'Staff', 'Dagger', 'Sword', 'GreatSword', 'Scythe', 'Polearm', 'Katana', 'GreatKatana', 'Club'}`<br>
<br>
`gs c ws <element>`<br>
Will use the mapped ws for current weaponset and given element. I.E: "Staff" equipped and command is set to ws light, it will use "Starburst"


#### Assistance

A texts module is implemented, meaning a GUI textbox will appear, given you're in a Abyssea area:

There is minimal automation built in, other than using correct WS with a command instead of configure multiple macros. 

Don't ask me to automate anything.
