**Description:** Make changing to weapon sets easier, see below.
<br/>

#### Commands

gs c toggle mainset set - Equip your mainset (to kill the NM as fast as possible after proc)
<br>
gs c toggle redproc set - Equip next weapon in list
<br>
    It goes in this order: {'Main', 'Staff', 'Dagger', 'Sword', 'GreatSword', 'Scythe', 'Polearm', 'Katana', 'GreatKatana', 'Club'}
<br>
gs c ws <element> - Will use the mapped ws for current weaponset and given element. I.E: "Staff" equipped and command is set to ws light, it will use "Starburst"


#### Assistance

A texts module is implemented, meaning a GUI textbox will appear, given you're in a Abyssea area:

"<insert picture>"

There is minimal automation built in, other than using correct WS with a command instead of configure multiple macros. 

Don't ask me to automate anything.
